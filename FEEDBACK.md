### Comments on the grading
- Some code are written by an LLM. If you convince me that you have written this code, I will upgrade your grade to an E
```python
total_length = sum(len(line) for line in lines)


```

- We have discussed in class to not use `while-true`
- 

### Grade: M

### Participation Grade: U
 - If participation grade is unsatisfactory check the `NO` in the documents sections
